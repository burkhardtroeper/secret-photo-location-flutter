# Special Photo Location

2021 Flutter Version

## What is it?

Years ago I created the SPL-App in AngularJS/Ionic 1. IT history so to say ;-)

I started with Flutter some time ago I really felt in love with it. So here comes Special Photo Location in Flutter.

Backend will be Firebase, when data in backend is implemented.

Current status is: photos can only be chosen from phone gallery. No local storage implemented yet.

App is going to be released in the app stores.

## Work in progress!!!
